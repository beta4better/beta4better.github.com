1. Micromanaging. Employees want to autonomy in the way they work. Micromanaging is oppressive, fosters anxiety and creates a high stress work environment. If you hired someone for a job, then trust them to get the job done. No one can perform at their best being constantly monitored and scrutinized.
2. No opportunities for Growth and Development. Managers need to know their employees and what motivates them. Assign challenging projects that motivate employees and give them stretch targets which will cause them to grow. If they have plateaued and there is nothing else to look forward to, they will become disengaged.
3. Lack of Empathy. If an employee is facing an issue whether personal or professional show empathy. When you go beyond the call of duty for your employer, and they respond with inflexibility and insensitivity during your time of need, the relationship at that exact moment is lost.
4. Not supporting Work Life Balance - Employees want to treated as human beings. They have emotions, feelings and personal lives. Always encroaching on employees personal time by pushing them to work long hours or weekends breeds resentment and disloyalty.
5. Not Recognizing and Rewarding Employees efforts. This is a great demotivator. Everyone wants to feel appreciated. When you don't value employees contributions, they become disengaged in the outcomes. They will not feel motivated to go the extra mile.
