We'll unfortunately be shutting OhLife down on October 4, 2014. 

We started OhLife to help people remember what's happened in their life. But since then we haven't been able to grow our user base or make OhLife financially stable. Because of both these reasons we've decided to shut OhLife down. We appreciate everyone that's used OhLife and supported us.

We're extremely sorry for shutting the site down.

We have some FAQs below to help out. Thank you for all your support.

Thank you,
The OhLife Team

How do I export my entries?
You can save your entries to a text file here: https://ohlife.com/export
Please export them before we shut down and delete them on October 4, 2014.

How do I save photos?
The Past page (https://ohlife.com/past) has a list of all your entries, so you can quickly scroll through them to find your photos. If you click a photo it will take you to the original version.

What if I had a premium account?
If you had the premium version, a few weeks after we shut OhLife down we'll refund you a prorated amount.


以上是我9月21号收到 OhLife 发的最后一封邮件，22号的时候本来想写点什么东西，但是翻邮件的时候发现怎么没有，然后往前翻看到了这封。实在是出乎意料的事情。之前有陆陆续续看到提供免费服务的网站关掉，看来免费的事情想盈利还真的不是那么容易。而且像 OhLife 他们是从来么有内嵌什么广告的。

感谢 OhLife 从10年10月26号陪我走到现在。
