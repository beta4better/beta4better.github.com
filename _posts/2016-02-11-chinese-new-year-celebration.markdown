　　It is the money given to kids fromtheir parents and grandparents as New Year gift. The money isbelieved to bring good luck, ward off monsters; hence the name "luckymoney". Parents and grandparents first put money in small,especially-made red envelopes and give the red envelopes to theirkids after the New Year's Feast or when they come to visit them onthe New Year. They choose to put the money in red envelopes becauseChinese people think red is a lucky color. They want to give theirchildren both lucky money and lucky color。

　　这是孩子们的父母和祖父母给他们作为春节礼物的钱。压岁钱据说能带来好运，能驱魔；因此，就有了“压岁钱”的称呼。父母和祖父母先把钱放入特制的小红包里，年夜饭后或当孩子们来拜年时，将红包发给他们。他们之所以要把钱放到红包里，是因为中国人认为红色是个幸运色。他们想给自己孩子既有压岁钱还有幸运色。
