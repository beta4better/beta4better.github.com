What seems like madness now may be the fashion in the future. 

I like you, each part of you. The world is big, but I'm heading home. I can't live without you, so I keep on waiting. Thanks to you, everything is just fine. No matter how long I have to walk through darkness, sooner or later I'll be standing in the sun. Forgive me for being helpless at times. There's not much I have done for you but you've given me more than I can ask.
