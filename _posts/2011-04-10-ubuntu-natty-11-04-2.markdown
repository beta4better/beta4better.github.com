<p>I get to know ubuntu from 2006, while I was a still a student used ubuntu for a while. At that time I tried many dist of linux, such as Debian, RedHat, Fedora, CentOS SUSE, Gentoo, even LFS. But finally turn to Debian. Now I&#8217;m coming back to Ubuntu on my laptop. Hope everything goes well.</p>
