Looks big change will come soon, though we have been waiting for Webstore for a quite long time. 

    Remove Webstore and default Chrome apps replaced by default ARC ones
    
    On newer ARC-enabled devices, Webstore search is no longer enabled.
    This CL also removes it from the launcher, as well as the Chrome versions of the default apps that were replaced by their corresponding ARC apps.
