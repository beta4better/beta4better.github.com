I have my own Chromebook, I love it, but I did not use it everyday. I want to write some introduction about Chromebooks. Chromebook now should have a lot users, but not everyone know it. Now here comes:

Google Chrome is designed for people who live on the web - searching for information, checking email, catching up on the news, shopping or just staying in touch with friends. However, the operating systems that browsers run on were designed in an era where there was no web. So Google announced a new project that’s a natural extension of Google Chrome - the Google Chrome Operating System to re-think what operating systems should be. 

Google Chrome OS is an open source, lightweight operating system that will initially be targeted at netbooks. Speed, simplicity and security are the key aspects of Google Chrome OS, designed to be fast and lightweight, to start up and get you onto the web in a few seconds. The user interface is minimal to stay out of your way, and most of the user experience takes place on the web. Like the Google Chrome browser, going back to the basics and completely redesigning the underlying security architecture of the OS, users don’t have to deal with viruses, malware and security updates. It should just work. 

The software architecture is simple - Google Chrome running within a new windowing system on top of a Linux kernel. For application developer, the web is the platform. All web-based application will automatically work and new applications can be written using your favorite web technologies. And of course, these apps will run not only on Google Chrome OS, but on any standards-based browser on Windows, Mac and Linux hereby giving developers the largest user base of any platform. 

Google Chrome OS is being created for people who spend most of their time on the web, and is being designed to power computers ranging from small netbooks to full-size desktop systems. Computers need to get better. People want to get to their email instantly, without wasting time waiting for their computers to boot and browsers to start up. They want their computers to always run as fast as when they first bought them. They want their data to be accessible to them wherever they are and not have to worry about losing their computer or forgetting to backup files. Even more importantly, they don't want to spend hours configuring their computers to work with every new piece of hardware, or have to worry about constant software updates.

Google announced the Chrome OS on July 07, 2009, this is the original link. Most of the words above is from that link. The points which wrote eight years ago are still the talking points now for Chrome OS, so foresight.
