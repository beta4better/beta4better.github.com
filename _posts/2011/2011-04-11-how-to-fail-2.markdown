<p>This is some words from Seth&#8217;s Blog, a article about <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/04/how-to-fai.html">how to fail</a>. After reading that post, you may have a different opinion about fail.</p>

<blockquote>Successful people fail often, and, worth noting, learn more from that failure than everyone else.</blockquote>

<p>Here are six random ideas that will help you fail better, more often and with an inevitably positive upside:</p>

<ul><li>Whenever possible, take on specific projects.</li>
    <li>Make detailed promises about what success looks like and when it will occur.</li>
    <li>Engage others in your projects. If you fail, they should be involved and know that they will fail with you.</li>
    <li>Be really clear about what the true risks are. Ignore the vivid, unlikely and ultimately non-fatal risks that take so much of our focus away.</li>
    <li>Concentrate your energy and will on the elements of the project that you have influence on, ignore external events that you can&#8217;t avoid or change.</li>
    <li>When you fail (and you will) be clear about it, call it by name and outline specifically what you learned so you won&#8217;t make the same mistake twice. People who blame others for failure will never be good at failing, because they&#8217;ve never done it.</li>
</ul>
