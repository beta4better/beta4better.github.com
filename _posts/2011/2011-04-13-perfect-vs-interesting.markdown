<p>Also some words from Seth&#8217;s Blog.</p>

<p>There are two jobs available to most of us:</p>

<p>You can be the person or the organization that&#8217;s perfect. The one that always ships on time, without typos, that delivers flawlessly and dots every i. You can be the hosting company or the doctor that might be boring, but is always right.</p>

<p>Or you can be the person or the organization that&#8217;s interesting. The thing about being interesting, making a ruckus, creating remarkable products and being magnetic is that you only have to be that way once in a while. No one is expected to be interesting all the time.</p>

<p>When an interesting person is momentarily not-interesting, I wait patiently. When a perfect organization, the boring one that&#8217;s constantly using its policies to dumb things down, is imperfect, I get annoyed. Because perfect has to be perfect all the time.</p>

<p>或许可以换句话说：生于忧患死于安乐，亦或者是人挪死树挪活。</p>
